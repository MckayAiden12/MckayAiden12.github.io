                <h2>Problem Statement: Better Phone Mapping</h2>
                <p>
                    In the University of South Carolina, there is no one good way to figure out where to get 
                    to your classes as an incoming student. While a map of the buildings is provided, students are 
                    left clueless as to where in the massive buildings their classrooms are. Our app aims to provide 
                    an interactive and simple way to help students better locate their classes and navigate through 
                    campus.
