  <p>Walk into any store and you'll be presented with pretzels in every flavor shape and size, but what makes</p>
  <p>this treat stand out from the rest? Besides the obvious pretzel shape, there is at least one major difference</p>
  <p>this staple snack has over the rest, its range andflexibility. Pretzels can be so many things, including:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Hard</li>
    <li>Soft</li>
    <li>Spicy</li>
    <li>Savory</li>
    <li>Sweet</li>
    <li>Cold</li>
    <li>Hot</li>
    <li>And so much more..</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The biggest difference in pretzel philosophy, is between the soft and hard pretzel variants. This texture shift</p>
  <p>makes an even larger change on a consumer's diet. According to an article featured on   
  <a href ="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-pretzels-healthy#nutrition"><strong>healthline.com</strong></a>, hard</p>
  <p>pretzels outmatch soft pretzels in nearly every nutritional matchup. Below is a graph which presents the basic</p>
  <p>nutional differences between soft and hard pretzels:</p>  
  
  <br>
    <table border="5">
      <tr> 
        <th></th>
        <th>1 soft pretzel with salt(120 grams)</th>
        <th>1.5 ounces of hard pretzels (42.5 grams)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Calories</th>
        <td>408</td>
        <td>163</td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <th>Fat (grams)</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Sodium (percentage)</th>
        <td>41% daily value</td>
        <td>23% daily value</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  <br>
  <p>The graph presents some disturbing truths about our soft friends. They contain more calories, fat, and close to</p>
  <p>half of the recommended daily sodium intake. They seem like a worse choice on every level except for texture.</p>
  <p><a href ="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048073/are-pretzels-healthy"><strong>EatingWell.com</strong></a> would argue against that conclusion, as they make a compelling argument for the pretzels'</p>
  <p>softer younger brother. They say that pretzels can be used to dip into protein rich or fat rich substances to make</p>  
  <p>up for the added calories. This valid argument turns the battle into more of a stalemate, as the choice becomes</p>
  <p>less about pure calories, and more about how they are being treated. In conclusion, pretzels are a special snack</p>
  <p>to be savored, but also a treat to be monitered.</p>
