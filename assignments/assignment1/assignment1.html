  <p>Walk into any store and you'll be presented with pretzels in every flavor shape and size,</p>
  <p>but what makes this treat stand out from the rest? Beside the obvious pretzel shape, there</p>
  <p>is at least one major difference this staple snack has over the rest, its flexibility. Pretzels</p>
  <p>can be hard, soft, chocolate dipped, cinnamon sprayed, and so much more. The biggest difference</p>
  <p>is between the soft and hard pretzel variants. This major difference in texutre, makes an even</p>
  <p>larger change on a consumer's diet. According to an article featured on   
    <a href ="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-pretzels-healthy#nutrition"><strong>healthline.com</strong></a>, hard</p>
  <p>pretzels outmatch soft pretzels in nearly every nutritional matchup. Below is a graph presenting</p>
  <p>the basice nutional difference between soft and hard pretzels:</p><br>


    <table border="5">
      <tr> 
        <th></th>
        <th>1 soft pretzel with salt(120 grams)</th>
        <th>1.5 ounces of hard pretzels (42.5 grams)</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Calories</th>
        <td>408</td>
        <td>163</td>
      </tr>
      <tr> 
        <th>Fat (grams)</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Sodium (percentage)</th>
        <td>41% daily value</td>
        <td>23% daily value</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
<p>The graph presents some disturbing truths about our soft friends. They contain more calories, fat, and close</p>
<p>to half of the recommended daily sodium intake. Overall they seem like a worse choice on every level except for</p>
<p>texture. <a href ="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8048073/are-pretzels-healthy"><strong>EatingWell.com</strong></a> would argue against that conclusion, as they make a compelling argument for the pretzels'</p>
<p>softer younger brother. They say that pretzels can be used to dip into protein rich or fat rich substances to</p>
<p>make up for the added calories. This valid argument turns the battle into more of a stalemate, as the choice</p>
<p>becomes less about pure calories, and more about how they are being treated.</p>
